## üö® Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Convex rate limits with high-frequency chunks
- **Mitigation**: Implement adaptive chunk sizing and batching

- **Risk**: OAuth configuration issues on deployment
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with staging environment

- **Risk**: Data migration failures
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration with rollback capability

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: Confusing stream recovery UX
- **Mitigation**: Clear visual indicators and user education

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large conversations
- **Mitigation**: Pagination and lazy loading implementation

---

## üìù Notes

### Current Focus

Working on authentication UI components and Google OAuth setup for Vercel deployment.

### Recent Decisions

- High-frequency chunk writing for real-time experience
- MCP tool calls embedded in message metadata
- 6-hour cleanup for stream sessions
- Cross-tab mirroring for stream operations

### Next Major Milestones

1. Complete authentication flow (this week)
2. Integrate streaming with chat API (next week)
3. Deploy to Vercel with full functionality (end of month)
