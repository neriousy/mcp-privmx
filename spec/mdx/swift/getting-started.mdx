title: Getting Started
---

## Initial Requirements

To start developing using PrivMX Endpoint Swift follow our [quick start guide](../start/quick-start) first

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

You also need to use your own application server to manage users (and their keys) and Contexts.

## Installation

Our Swift packages contain all the necessary assets and helpers to get started with PrivMX Endpoint. Select which level is the best for you. 
Go to [Swift overview](../swift) to see the descriptions of each package.

### Swift Dependencies
Swift Dependencies are managed by Swift Package Manager, and published on Simplito's [Github](https://github.com/simplito).

1. Add `privmx-endpoint-swift-extra` package to your project using Xcode's built-in package management:

```
https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-swift-extra
```

It should be present in Package Dependencies as well as in target's "Link Binary With Libraries" section.

2. Everywhere you want to use PrivMX Package, you need to import:

```swift
import PrivMXEndpointSwift
import PrivMXEndpointSwiftExtra
import PrivMXEndpointSwiftNative
```

### Shared Libraries
Our `privmx-endpoint-swift-extra` package depends on `privmx-endpoint-swift` package, 
which depends on a set of native libraries, which are downloaded automatically by Xcode.
They are all compiled for arm and Intel architectures for using with iOS, macOS and simulator environments.

## Initial Assumptions

The initial assumptions for all the code examples below are as follows:

```swift
/*
    All the values below like BRIDGE_URL, SOLUTION_ID, CONTEXT_ID
    should be replaced by the ones corresponding to your Bridge Server instance.
    
    The private keys here are for demonstration purposes only.
    Normally, they should be kept separately by each user and stored in a safe place,
    or generated from a password (see the derivePrivateKey2() method in the Crypto API)
    */

let BRIDGE_URL = "YOUR_BRIDGE_URL";
let SOLUTION_ID = "YOUR_SOLUTION_ID";
let CONTEXT_ID = "YOUR_CONTEXT_ID";

let USER1_ID = "USER_ID_1";
let USER1_PUBLIC_KEY = "PUBLIC_KEY_1";
let USER1_PRIV = "PRIVATE_KEY_1";

let USER2_ID = "USER_ID_2";
let USER2_PUBLIC_KEY = "PUBLIC_KEY_2";

let USER3_ID = "USER_ID_3";
let USER3_PUBLIC_KEY = "PUBLIC_KEY_3";
```

## Connecting to PrivMX Bridge

To use any of the library's elements, you must first connect to PrivMX Bridge.
Use the API keys mentioned [earlier](#initial-requirements). You can use `PrivMXEndpointContainer` and its helper functions or manually instantiate `PrivMXEndpoint`.
This is the most recommended approach.

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Swift Extra","Swift Basic"]}>
<Tab>
```swift
 // Initialize the endpoint container
var endpointContainer = PrivMXEndpointContainer()

// Set the path to the certificate matching Your installation
guard let pathToCerts = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "cacert", ofType: "pem") else { return }
try endpointContainer.setCertsPath(to: pathToCerts)

// Establish a new endpoint session
var endpointSession = try await endpointContainer.newEndpoint(
    enabling: [.thread,.store,.inbox],
    connectingAs: USER1_PRIVATE_KEY,
    to: SOLUTION_ID,
    on: BRIDGE_URL
)		
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```swift
// Set the path to the certificate matching Your installation
guard let pathToCerts = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "cacert", ofType: "pem") else {return}
try? Connection.setCertsPath(pathToCerts)
// Establish a new endpoint session
var endpointSession = try? PrivMXEndpoint(
    modules: [.thread,.store,.inbox],
    userPrivKey: USER1_PRIVATE_KEY,
    solutionId: SOLUTION_ID,
    bridgeUrl: BRIDGE_URL)
```

Alternatively: 
```swift
// Set the path to the certificate matching Your installation
guard let pathToCerts = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "cacert", ofType: "pem") else {return}
try? Connection.setCertsPath(pathToCerts)
// Establish connection
guard var connection = try? Connection.connect(
    as: USER1_PRIVATE_KEY,
    to: BRIDGE_URL,
    on: CONTEXT_ID) as? Connection
else {return}
// Init required API's
guard var storeApi = try? StoreApi.create(connection: &connection) else {return}
guard var threadApi = try? ThreadApi.create(connection: &connection) else {return}
guard let inboxApi = try? InboxApi.create(
    connection: &connection,
    threadApi: &threadApi,
    storeApi: &storeApi) else {return}
                                    
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Certificates should be set up accordingly to the Local Bridge Installation. More details are available [here](../start/certificates).

The active connection is kept by [`endpointContainer`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-swift-extra/core/privmx-endpoint-container) and can be accessed with `getPrivmxEndpoint()` function.
<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Swift"]}>
<Tab>
```swift
let endpointSessionId:Int64 = 0 //need to be initialized during session setup
let endpointSession = endpointContainer?.getEndpoint(endpointSessionId)
//by passing value indexed by connectionID
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Disconnecting from PrivMX Bridge

While using `PrivMXEndpointContainer`, you can run disconnect on `endpointContainer` object. It ends all underlying connections.

<Tab>
```swift
 try? endpointContainer?.disconnectAll()
```

## Compilation

Compilation requires C++ interoperability turned on in the project settings, which can be found here:

```
Project > Target > Build Settings > C++ and Objective-C interoperability = C++ / Objective-C++
```

## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all of the Platform's capabilities. 

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages;
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted file;
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
