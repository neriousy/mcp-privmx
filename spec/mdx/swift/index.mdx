This part of the documentation describes our solutions to simplify working with PrivMX Endpoint C++ library inside Swift projects.

## Libraries

### PrivMX Endpoint Swift Extra

PrivMX Endpoint Swift Extra is the basic **recommended library** for using the Platform in most cases. 
It contains all the logic that makes using our libraries simple and secure. 
It can be used on any Apple platform (iOS/macOS/simulators).

This library implements:

- Enums and static fields to reduce errors while using the methods.
- [`PrivmxEndpoint`](./reference/privmx-endpoint-swift-extra/core/privmx-endpoint) for managing connection and registering callbacks on any events.
- [`PrivmxEndpointContainer`](./reference/privmx-endpoint-swift-extra/core/privmx-endpoint-container) for managing global session with implemented event loop.
- Classes to simplify reading/writing to files using byte arrays and FileHandles.

[Go to Reference](./reference/privmx-endpoint-swift-extra/core/privmx-endpoint) for a detailed description of each class.

### PrivMX Endpoint Swift

PrivMX Endpoint Swift is the minimal wrapper library, crucial for the Platform's functioning. It declares native functions in Swift using C++ interoperability, so it's crucial to turn it on in compiler Settings.

This library implements models, exception catching, and the following modules:
- `CryptoApi` - Cryptographic methods used to encrypt/decrypt and sign your data or generate keys to work with PrivMX Bridge.
- `Connection` - Methods for managing connection with PrivMX Bridge.
- `ThreadApi` - Methods for managing Threads and sending/reading messages.
- `StoreApi` - Methods for managing Stores and sending/reading files.
- `InboxApi` - Methods for managing Inboxes and entries.
