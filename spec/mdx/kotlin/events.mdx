:::info

Before working with Events, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./introduction). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.

The sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./introduction#initial-assumptions)**.

:::

These events are triggered automatically when a relevant change occurs. You can subscribe to them by registering event listeners. This allows you to respond to changes as they happen in real-time.


## Caveats

- All callbacks are related to the connection on which they were registered.
- Calling [`PrivmxEndpointContainer.stopListening()`](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/com.simplito.kotlin.privmx_endpoint_extra.lib/-privmx-endpoint-container/stop-listening.html) does not delete event listeners.
- Disconnecting deletes all event listeners related to the connection.

## Quick Start

<div className={'fd-steps'}>
   <div className={'fd-step'}>

Start the event loop:
```kotlin
endpointContainer.startListening()
```
   </div>
       <div className={'fd-step'}>
Add event listener for 'ThreadCreatedEvent' related with `callbackID`
```kotlin
val callbackID = "CALLBACK_ID"
endpointSession.registerCallback(
    callbackID,
    EventType.ThreadCreatedEvent
){ newThreadData ->
    // some actions with newThreadData
}
```
       </div>
           <div className={'fd-step'}>
Remove the event listener when no longer needed:
```kotlin
endpointSession.unregisterCallbacks(callbackID)
```
   </div>
</div>
## Unregister Callbacks

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["By Callback ID", "All Callbacks"]}>
<Tab value="By Callback ID">
Unregister all callbacks identified by `callbacksID`:
```kotlin
val callbacksID = "CALLBACKS_ID"
endpointSession.unregisterCallbacks(callbacksID)
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="All Callbacks">
Unregister all callbacks from the connection:
```kotlin
endpointSession.unregisterAll()
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>
