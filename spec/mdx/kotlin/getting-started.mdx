title: Getting Started
---


## Initial Requirements

Before starting developing using PrivMX Endpoint Kotlin follow our [quick start guide](../start/quick-start)

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

You also need to use your own application server to manage users (and their keys) and Contexts.

## Adding Dependencies

1. Add `mavenCentral()` repository to your `settings.gradle.kts`:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

2. Add dependency to `build.gradle.kts`:

```groovy
kotlin {
  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("com.simplito.kotlin:privmx-endpoint:$privmxLibVersion")
        // optionally you can add privmx-endpoint-extra dependency
//        implementation("com.simplito.kotlin:privmx-endpoint-extra:$privmxLibVersion")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## JVM
You have to pass path to PrivMX Endpoint native libraries directory by configuring
`-Djava.library.path=<path-to-your-libraries-dir>` system property during run application.

**You can download pre-compiled zipped native binaries for each supported JVM platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-kotlin/releases).**

## Android
### Native Libraries
Before build your project you have to attach PrivMX Endpoint native libraries to Android build process by adding them
to jniLibs sourceSet directory (`src/main/jniLibs` by default) for each supported ABI.

**You can download pre-compiled zipped native binaries for each supported Android ABI from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-kotlin/releases).**

### Required Permissions
PrivMX Endpoint requires to add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml:
* `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

## Initial Assumptions
The initial assumptions for all the code examples below are as follows:

``` kotlin
/*
    All the values below like BRIDGE_URL, SOLUTION_ID, CONTEXT_ID
    should be replaced by the ones corresponding to your Bridge Server instance.

    The private keys here are for demonstration purposes only.
    Normally, they should be kept separately by each user and stored in a safe place,
    or generated from a password (see the derivePrivateKey2() method in the Crypto API)
*/

val bridgeUrl = "YOUR_BRIDGE_URL"
val solutionId = "YOUR_SOLUTION_ID"
val contextId = "YOUR_CONTEXT_ID"

val user1Id = "USER_ID_1"
val user1PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_1"
val user1PrivateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY_1"

val user2Id = "USER_ID_2"
val user2PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_2"
```

## Connecting to PrivMX Bridge

To use any of the library's elements, you must first connect to PrivMX Bridge.
Use the API keys mentioned [earlier](#initial-requirements):

``` kotlin
val pathToCerts = "PATH_TO_CERTS" // Path to .pem ssl certificate to connect with Privmx Bridge
val initModules = setOf(
    Modules.THREAD, // initializes ThreadApi to working with Threads
    Modules.STORE, // initializes StoreApi to working with Stores
    Modules.INBOX // initializes InboxApi to working with Inboxes
) // set of modules to activate in new connection

val endpointContainer = PrivmxEndpointContainer().also {
    it.setCertsPath(pathToCerts)
}

val endpointSession = endpointContainer.connect(
    initModules,
    user1PrivateKey,
    solutionId,
    bridgeUrl
)
```

The active connection is kept by [`container`](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/com.simplito.kotlin.privmx_endpoint_extra.lib/-privmx-endpoint-container/index.html) and can be accessed using [`container.getEndpoint(Long)`](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/com.simplito.kotlin.privmx_endpoint_extra.lib/-privmx-endpoint-container/get-endpoint.html) method.
``` kotlin
endpointContainer.getEndpoint(endpointSession.connection.getConnectionId()!!)
```
## Disconnecting from PrivMX Bridge

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["By Connection ID","All Connections"]}>
<Tab >
```kotlin
endpointContainer.disconnect(endpointSession.connection.getConnectionId()!!)
```
</Tab>
<Tab>

``` kotlin
endpointContainer.disconnectAll()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Closing `PrivmxEndpointContainer`
When you finish working with the `container`, close it to end all connections, close the event loop, and release the resources being used.
You can also use a `use` function in Kotlin.
``` kotlin
endpointContainer.close()
```

## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all of the platform's capabilities. 

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages;
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted files;
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
