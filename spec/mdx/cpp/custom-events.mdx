title: Custom Events
description: Custom events allow emitting and receiving data of any shape in a secure, end-to-end encrypted way.
---

Custom events allow you to send information to specific groups of users. The data will not be stored anywhere. 
For an event to reach the recipient, the recipient must be subscribed to the channel on which you are emitting the event at that moment.

Before working with Custom Events, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./introduction). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.

Sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**.

## Working with Custom Events

### Key Considerations

Please note the following:

- Events will only trigger for active connections.
- Events are not captured unless explicitly listened for.
- A single instance of the `eventQueue` is shared across all connections.


### Emitting and Handling Custom Events
Below there is simple code example of how to emit an Event with the custom payload and then how to handle it when it arrives to the recipients.

```cpp
// ...

#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Connection.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/event/EventApi.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Buffer.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/core/EventQueue.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/event/Events.hpp>

// ...

core::EventQueue eventQueue {core::EventQueue::getInstance()};

// Start the EventQueue reading loop
std::thread t([&](){
    while(true) {
        core::EventHolder event = eventQueue.waitEvent();
        if (event::Events::isContextCustomEvent(event)) {
            auto customEvent = event::Events::extractContextCustomEvent(event);
            std::cout << "Received event:" << std::endl;
            std::cout << "contextId: " << customEvent.data.contextId << std::endl;
            std::cout << "sender: " << customEvent.data.userId << std::endl;
            std::cout << "payload: " << customEvent.data.payload.stdString() << std::endl;
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(5));
    }
});

// initialize Endpoint connection and the Event API
auto connection {core::Connection::connect(USER1_PRIVATE_KEY, SOLUTION_ID, BRIDGE_URL)};
auto eventApi {event::EventApi::create(connection)};

// Subscribe for the Thread's events
eventApi.subscribeForCustomEvents(CONTEXT_ID, "myChannel");

// sending event to myself
std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> recipients {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

// Emit event
eventApi.emitEvent(
    CONTEXT_ID, 
    recipients, 
    "myChannel", 
    core::Buffer::from("some data")
);

t.join();

```
