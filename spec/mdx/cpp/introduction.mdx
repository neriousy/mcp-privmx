## Initial Requirements

To start developing end-to-end encrypted applications using PrivMX Endpoint you need a **PrivMX Bridge** instance, you can find quick start guide [here](../start/quick-start).

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

You also need to use your own application server to manage users (and their keys) and Contexts.

## Using Public and Private Keys
You need a private key to connect PrivMX Endpoint to your Bridge. **Private key will never leave PrivMX Endpoint**.
- PrivMX Endpoint uses the user's private key to encrypt, decrypt and verify data on the client side only.
- PrivMX Bridge stores only the public part, i.e., the user's public key and user's ID.

## Setting up PrivMX Endpoint Client

### Install and Configure Conan
To use PrivMX Endpoint you need to add it to your project using Conan Repository Manager. 
[How to install Conan](https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html).

#### Setup Conan with our Repository
```bash
conan profile detect --force
conan remote add privmx https://libs.simplito.com/artifactory/api/conan/privmx
```
## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all the capabilities of PrivMX Endpoint and PrivMX Bridge.

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages.
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted files.
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
