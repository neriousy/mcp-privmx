:::info

Before working with Stores, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./introduction). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.

Sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**.

## Working with Stores

When working with Stores, you will use the following:
- `StoreApi` - provides methods used to manage Stores in given Context


Let's modify the program from the [First App](./first-app) chapter to connect to the Bridge server, create a Store, and put the first file in it.

**`CMakeLists.txt`**
```cmake
...
target_link_libraries(test_program PUBLIC 
		privmxendpoint::privmxendpointcore
        privmxendpoint::privmxendpointstore
		privmxendpoint::crypto
)
```

**`main.cpp`**
```cpp
// setup some defaults
core::PagingQuery defaultListQuery = {.skip = 0, .limit = 100, .sortOrder = "desc"};

// initialize Endpoint connection and Stores API
auto connection {core::Connection::connect(USER1_PRIVATE_KEY, SOLUTION_ID, BRIDGE_URL)};
auto storeApi {store::StoreApi::create(connection)};

// ...
```
## Creating Stores
Creating a basic, unnamed Store, which can act as an encrypted data container:

```cpp
// ...

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> managers {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> users {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY},
    {.userId = USER2_ID, .pubKey = USER2_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

// create a new Store with access for USER_1 as manager and USER_2 as regular user
auto storeId {storeApi.createStore(
    CONTEXT_ID, 
    users, managers, 
    core::Buffer::from("some Store's public meta-data"), 
    core::Buffer::from("some Store's private meta-data")
)};

// ...
```
Hint: You can assign any data to private and public meta fields (e.g. the Store's name), as long as it is serialized and can be given as the `core::Buffer`.

## Fetching Stores

Getting a list of Stores available for the user in the given Context:

```cpp
// ...

auto storesList = storeApi.listStores(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery);

// ...
```

As a result you will receive an object:
```cpp
// storesList:
{
    readItems: [<storeObject1>, <storeObject2>,..., <storeObjectN>],
    totalAvailable: <number_of_all_stores>
}
```

Getting a single Store:

```cpp
// ...

auto store = storeApi.getStore(storeId, defaultListQuery);

// ...
```
A detailed description of the `Store` object fields can be found in [API Reference](../reference/endpoint/store/types#store).

## Modifying Stores


### How Updates Work
To update a Store, you must always provide a full list of parameters.

The `updateStore(...)` method needs all the parameters as in the `createStore(...)` method and a few more. If you want to update
one of the parameters – provide it in a new modified form. If, on the other hand, you want to leave
the parameter unchanged – provide it as it was before.

```cpp
// ...
auto currentStore {storeApi.getStore(storeId)};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> managers {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> users {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

// update a new Store with access for USER_1 as the only user.
storeApi.updateStore(
    storeId, 
    users, managers, 
    currentStore.publicMeta, 
    currentStore.privateMeta,
    currentStore.version, // <- pass the version of the Store you will perform the update on
    false, // <- force update (without checking version)
    false // <- force to regenerate a key for the Store
);

// ...
```
