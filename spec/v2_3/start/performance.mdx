## Native C++ Version

The following tables show the estimated PrivMX Endpoint performance on chosen platforms.
The assumptions of the tests are as follows:
- each operation is repeated 100 times
- the file used for the test (if applicable) has a size of 1 MB
- network latency is negligible, because the tests are performed using a local server instance
- `getMessage()/sendMessage` gets/sends a 1KB message
- entries used by the `readEntry()/sendEntry()` have a 1MB file attached

### Platform: Core i7 12gen

| **Container** | **Operation (x100)**     |**min (ms)**    |**max (ms)**   |**avg (ms)**    |
|--------|---------------       |------ |-------|-------|
|Thread |getMessage     |19     |44     |25
|Thread |sendMessage    |7      |18     |8
|Store  |readFromFile   |53     |75     |58
|Store  |writeToFile    |51     |78     |63
|Inbox    |readEntry      |71     |137    |81
|Inbox    |sendEntry      |59     |116    |73

### Platform: ARMv7 32bit (RPi2)
