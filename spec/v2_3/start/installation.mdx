title: Installation
---

<Callout>
Before you start, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
You might also want to use PrivMX Bridge in non dockerized version, which requires more configuration and is recommended for advanced users. In that case, please refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-bridge)
</Callout>

To install Bridge on your machine you can use our CLI.

1. Clone Bridge CLI
     ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/simplito/privmx-bridge-docker
    ```
2. Run setup script
    ```shell
    ./setup.sh
   ```

This will fetch the necessary Docker images, create Access Keys and your first Context. After a successful setup, CLI
will
display all the API keys necessary for connection. <br/>

### Registering first users (optionally)

You can create first two users using provided CLI. This can come handy if you want to just test PrivMX in  one of our example projects.

1. Generate keys
    In your terminal, generate private-public key pair for your user. The keys must be in WIF format:
     ```shell
    ./genKeyPair.sh
    ```
2. Register user
    With the keys ready, register `userId` - public key pair in your Context. Don't forget to replace placeholder values
    with the ones created earlier:
    ```shell
    ./cli.sh context/addUserToContext '{"contextId": "CONTEXT_ID", "userId":"USER_ID", "userPubKey":"USER_PUBLIC_KEY" }'
    ```
### After Installing

After you've successfully installed a PrivMX Bridge instance, browse our SDKs and APIs to learn what you can do next:

## Integrations

• **Server API** - Managing the base of user keys - assigning/removing them to/from Contexts.

• **Server Event Channels** (Coming Soon) - The ability to wait for changes in the Bridge and send notifications about them. The Developer's server could for example react to a new message or file. The server can only access metadata (UUID, User IDs assigned by the Developer), so the information about who, when and where sent or modified data.

• **Server Data Management** (Coming Soon) - Data management based on metadata. The server can list and delete data collected in the Bridge.
