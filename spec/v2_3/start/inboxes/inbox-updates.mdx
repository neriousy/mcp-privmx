Events play a crucial role in modern applications, allowing them to instantly respond to changes in stored data. Monitoring and reacting to entries and Inbox-related events, is essential for maintaining up-to-date records, triggering workflows, and ensuring synchronization across various parts of the system.

## Types of Events

Before receiving Events, your application must first subscribe to a group of events.
In the case of Inbox, types of events are the following:

Inbox events:
- `inboxCreated` - triggers when a new Inbox is created in your Context
- `inboxDeleted` - triggers when an Inbox is deleted from your Context
- `inboxUpdated` - triggers when an Inbox is updated in your Context

Entry events:
- `inboxEntryCreated` - triggers when an entry is sent to an Inbox
- `inboxEntryDeleted` - triggers when an entry is deleted from an Inbox

## Handling Inbox Events

:::info

The sample code on this page is based on the same **[assumptions](./usage#initial-assumptions)** mentioned in [Working with Inboxes](./usage).

Here is an example of how to do it in your own project:
<Tabs groupId="lang" items={["JavaScript"]}>

<Tab >
Start by getting `eventQueue` instance using Endpoint:

```js
const eventQueue = await Endpoint.getEventQueue()
```

`EventQueue` provides `waitEvent` method that blocks main browser's thread.
To avoid freezing the entire app:

```js
    const eventQueue = await EndpointFactory.getEventQueue();
    let listenForEventsPromise = null;

    function listenForEvents(queue) {
        if (!listenForEventsPromise) {
            listenForEventsPromise = queue.waitEvent();
            listenForEventsPromise.then(result => {
                console.log("Event Received:", result);
                listenForEventsPromise = null;
                listenForEvents(queue);
            })
        }
    }

    listenForEvents(eventQueue);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can now subscribe for events you need:
<Tabs groupid="lang" items={["JavaScript"]}>
    <Tab >
        ```js
        await inboxApi.subscribeForInboxEvents()
        ```
        or
        ```js
        await inboxApi.subscribeForEntryEvents(inboxID)
        ```
        When no longer needed, you can unsubscribe from events:

        ```js
        await inboxApi.unSubscribeForInboxEvents()
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
