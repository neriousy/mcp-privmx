Threads allow the exchange of messages.
In this section, let's take a closer look at the structure of messages and how to send them. We will also discuss some good practice when working with Threads.

## About Messages

The structure of a message and a brief description of its elements is outlined in the following table:
|**field**|**type**|**encrypted**|**description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|`data`|binary|yes|content of the message
|`info`|ServerInfo|no|additional information assigned by the server e.g. author, `creationDate`, `messageID` and `threadID`
|`privateMeta`|binary|yes|additional information about the message
|`publicMeta`|binary|no|additional public information about the message, also accessible through Platform REST API

## Define structure

Thread's architecture does not require you to use a specific data structure inside the messages.
So before working with Threads, define what what kind of messages you want to send.

We recommend future-proofing your messages right from the start, i.e. choosing an easily modifiable format.

It is also a good idea to include its type and version in the structure of the message.

Here is an example message structure that you can use in your project.

``` json title="JSON"
{
   “data”:{
     “content”: "string", // string / binary data containing for example: markdown, html or json
   },
   “info”: "ServerInfo", // assigned by server,
   “publicMeta”:{
     “version”:number,
     “type”: “text”, // some kind of enum describing type of message like “event”, “html”,“markdown” etc.
   },
   “privateMeta”:{
     // meta fields
   }
}
```
Remember that it is only an example and you should consider your app's requirements and limitations.

## Sending

With the structure ready, its time to start sending messages.

:::info

Remember that before sending anything, you have to be connected to the Bridge - using `connect`.

        byte[] privateMeta = "My private meta".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        byte[] publicMeta = "My public meta".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        byte[] message = "My message".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

        String msgId = container.getEndpoint(connectionID).threadApi.sendMessage(
        threadId,
        publicMeta,
        privateMeta,
        message
        );
        ```

        ```kotlin
        val container = PrivmxEndpointContainer()
        val connectionID = 0L // your connection ID
        val threadId = "<THREAD_ID>"

        val privateMeta = "My private data".encodeToByteArray()
        val publicMeta = "My public data".encodeToByteArray()
        val message = "This is my message".encodeToByteArray()

        val msgId = container.getEndpoint(connectionID).threadApi.sendMessage(
        threadId,
        publicMeta,
        privateMeta,
        message
        )
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab >

        ```swift
        let threadId: String; // ID of thread taken from threadApi.threadList

        //for now we can leave them empty
        let privateMeta = Data("My private data".utf8)
        let publicMeta = Data("My public data".utf8)

        let message = Data("This is my message".utf8)

        let msgId: String = threadApi.sendMessage(
        in: threadId,
        publicMeta: publicMeta,
        privateMeta: privateMeta,
        data: message)
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


After sending the message, you will get its ID returned.

Message IDs are unique within a Context, allowing you to locate a message solely by its ID, without the need to know the associated Thread ID.


## Using Message Metadata

Metadata fields inside messages make it easier to integrate Threads into new and existing projects.
Threads are scheme agnostic by design, which makes them easy to integrate into any application.
Metadata also allows developers to add any functionalities required by their app.

### PrivateMeta

`privateMeta` includes additional sensitive information about the message.
It's useful when we need to include the user's private data (personal information, activity details) in the message.

Like the content of the message itself, `privateMeta` is **encrypted** before sending. Since it is saved as binary data, you are free to choose any format.
It can be a JSON parsed to a binary array or a more efficient binary format such as Protocol Buffers.

### PublicMeta

Unlike `privateMeta`, `publicMeta` is **not encrypted**.
It's useful when you want to include some additional info that does not require encryption.

`publicMeta` also does not have a specified structure and supports any binary format.

### Example: Response To Another Message

Let's say that you need to implement replies to other messages inside a Thread using `publicMeta`.

When sending a message, include the ID of the message you want to reply to.
Expanding on the example from the section on sending, it would look like that:

``` json title="JSON"
{
   "data":{
     "content": "string" // string / binary data containing for example: markdown, html or json
   },
   "info": "ServerInfo", // assigned by server,
   "publicMeta":{
     "version":"number",
     "type": “text”, // some kind of enum describing type of message like “event”, “html”,“markdown” etc.
     "responseTo":”{messageID}”
   },
}
```

When displaying the message in a chat, you will be able to find the message that was mentioned and display it according to the application's requirements.
