Thread container is a structured communication tool used for **message based communication**. 

Users create Threads to organize topic-specific conversations where they can securely **exchange encrypted messages** with designated participants.
All the active users are **notified** right away when a new message arrives or anything within the Thread changes. 

All the data is stored in [PrivMX Bridge](../privmx-bridge) and can be freely shared between its users.

## Prerequisites

Before working with Threads, you need to have a PrivMX Bridge instance.

To install it, [follow our PrivMX quick start guide](../quick-start).

## Architecture

Threads are time-sorted containers for messages. Think of a Thread as a container that allows you to **post messages, which can include any binary or text data as well as metadata.**
Each Thread has its own set of permissions, managed by assigning the usersâ€™ public keys to the Thread. **Only the users with assigned public keys can read the messages posted in that Thread.**
Decryption of these messages is possible only with the corresponding private keys. 

**Each message is protected by a synchronous key, which is further secured using an asynchronous pair of public and private user keys.**
This dual-layer encryption ensures that the system remains both safe and efficient.

## Messages in Threads

The main data units in Threads are messages, which contain binary `data`, as well as metadata

- `privateMeta` - encrypted data about the message
- `publicMeta` - **decrypted** additional data about the message

Each message also has information assigned by the Bridge.

To learn more about messages, go to [Sending Messages](./messages).
