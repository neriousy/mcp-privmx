title: Getting Started
---


## Initial Requirements

Before starting developing using PrivMX Endpoint Java follow our [quick start guide](../start/quick-start)

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

You also need to use your own application server to manage users (and their keys) and Contexts.

## Installation

Our Java libraries contain all the necessary assets and helpers to get started with PrivMX Endpoint. Select which level is the best for you. 
Go to Java [overview](../java/introduction) to see the descriptions of each library.

### Java Dependencies

1. Add `mavenCentral()` repository to your `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement{
    repositories{
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

2. Add dependency to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    def privmxLibVersion = "2.2.0" // privmx-endpoint-version
    implementation("com.simplito.java:privmx-endpoint-extra:$privmxLibVersion")
    //implementation("com.simplito.java:privmx-endpoint:$privmxLibVersion")  #for base Java library
    //implementation("com.simplito.java:privmx-endpoint-android:$privmxLibVersion")  #for Android Java library
}
```
### Shared Libraries
Java projects require you to install shared native libraries in a specified path and pass this path to java command as argument `-Djava.library.path=`.
In Android, you just need to put the libraries in the `src/main/jniLibs` directory.

Use our gradle plugin to download and unzip the shared libraries.

1. Add `mavenCentral()` repository to your `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
    repositories{
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

2. Add and configure the plugin in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "com.simplito.privmx-endpoint-install-native" version "$pluginVersion"
}

privmxEndpointInstallJni{
    version = $nativeLibVersion // this version should be the same as privmx-endpoint-java version
}
```

For more information about the plugin, go to its dedicated [section](./plugin-configuration).

Alternatively, download them from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-java/releases) assets with the same version as your `privmx-endpoint-java` library.

## Initial Assumptions
The initial assumptions for all the code examples below are as follows:

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Java","Kotlin"]}>
<Tab >
```java
/*
    All the values below like BRIDGE_URL, SOLUTION_ID, CONTEXT_ID
    should be replaced by the ones corresponding to your Bridge Server instance.

    The private keys here are for demonstration purposes only.
    Normally, they should be kept separately by each user and stored in a safe place,
    or generated from a password (see the derivePrivateKey2() method in the Crypto API)
*/

String bridgeUrl = "YOUR_BRIDGE_URL";
String solutionId = "YOUR_SOLUTION_ID";
String contextId = "YOUR_CONTEXT_ID";

String user1Id = "USER_ID_1";
String user1PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_1";
String user1PrivateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY_1";

String user2Id = "USER_ID_2";
String user2PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_2";
```
</Tab>
<Tab >
``` kotlin
/*
    All the values below like BRIDGE_URL, SOLUTION_ID, CONTEXT_ID
    should be replaced by the ones corresponding to your Bridge Server instance.

    The private keys here are for demonstration purposes only.
    Normally, they should be kept separately by each user and stored in a safe place,
    or generated from a password (see the derivePrivateKey2() method in the Crypto API)
*/

val bridgeUrl = "YOUR_BRIDGE_URL"
val solutionId = "YOUR_SOLUTION_ID"
val contextId = "YOUR_CONTEXT_ID"

val user1Id = "USER_ID_1"
val user1PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_1"
val user1PrivateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY_1"

val user2Id = "USER_ID_2"
val user2PublicKey = "PUBLIC_KEY_2"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Connecting to PrivMX Bridge

To use any of the library's elements, you must first connect to PrivMX Bridge.
Use the API keys mentioned [earlier](#initial-requirements):

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Java","Kotlin"]}>
<Tab >
```java
String pathToCerts = "PATH_TO_CERTS"; // Path to .pem ssl certificate to connect with Privmx Bridge
Set<Modules> initModules = Set.of(
        Modules.THREAD, // initializes ThreadApi to working with Threads
        Modules.STORE, // initializes StoreApi to working with Stores
        Modules.INBOX // initializes InboxApi to working with Inboxes
); // set of modules to activate in new connection

PrivmxEndpointContainer endpointContainer = new PrivmxEndpointContainer();
endpointContainer.setCertsPath(pathToCerts);

PrivmxEndpoint endpointSession = endpointContainer.connect(
        initModules,
        user1PrivateKey,
        solutionId,
        bridgeUrl
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab >

``` kotlin
val pathToCerts = "PATH_TO_CERTS" // Path to .pem ssl certificate to connect with Privmx Bridge
val initModules = setOf(
    Modules.THREAD, // initializes ThreadApi to working with Threads
    Modules.STORE, // initializes StoreApi to working with Stores
    Modules.INBOX // initializes InboxApi to working with Inboxes
) // set of modules to activate in new connection

val endpointContainer = PrivmxEndpointContainer().also {
    it.setCertsPath(pathToCerts)
}

val endpointSession = endpointContainer.connect(
    initModules,
    user1PrivateKey,
    solutionId,
    bridgeUrl
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The active connection is kept by [`container`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-extra/core/privmx-endpoint-container) and can be accessed using [`container.getEndpoint(Long)`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-extra/core/privmx-endpoint-container#getendpoint) method.
``` kotlin
endpointContainer.getEndpoint(endpointSession.connection.connectionId)
```
## Disconnecting from PrivMX Bridge

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["By Connection ID","All Connections"]}>
<Tab >
```kotlin
endpointContainer.disconnect(endpointSession.connection.connectionId)
```
</Tab>
<Tab>

``` kotlin
container.disconnectAll()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Closing `PrivmxEndpointContainer`
When you finish working with the `container`, close it to end all connections, close the event loop, and release the resources being used.
You can also use a `try-with-resources` block in Java or `use` function in Kotlin.
``` kotlin
container.close()
```

## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all of the platform's capabilities. 

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages;
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted files;
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
