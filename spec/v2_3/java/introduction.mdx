## Libraries

### Privmx Endpoint Java Extra

PrivMX Endpoint Java Extra is the basic **recommended library** for using the platform in most cases.
It contains all the logic that makes using our libraries simple and secure.
It can be used on Java Virtual Machines (JVM).

This library implements:

- Enums and static fields to reduce errors while using the methods.
- [`PrivmxEndpoint`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-extra/core/privmx-endpoint) for managing connection and registering callbacks on any events.
- [`PrivmxEndpointContainer`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-extra/core/privmx-endpoint-container) for managing global session with implemented event loop.
- Classes to simplify reading/writing to files using byte arrays and InputStream/OutputStream.

[Go to Reference](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-extra/core/basic-privmx-endpoint) for a detailed description of each class
or see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-java/tree/main/privmx-endpoint-extra).

### Privmx Endpoint Java Android

PrivMX Endpoint Java Android is an extension of `Privmx Endpoint Java Extra` with logic specifically for **Android**.

This library implements:

- [`PrivmxEndpointService`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-android/core/privmx-endpoint-service) - an Android Service that manages PrivMX Endpoint Java Extra library and handles app lifecycle changes.
- [`PrivmxEndpointBaseActivity`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-android/core/privmx-endpoint-base-activity) - Android Activity that configures and binds to [`PrivmxEndpointService`](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-android/core/privmx-endpoint-service).

[Go to Reference](../reference/privmx-endpoint-java-android/core/privmx-endpoint-base-activity) for a detailed description of each class
or see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-java/tree/main/privmx-endpoint-android).

### Privmx Endpoint Java

PrivMX Endpoint Java is the minimal wrapper library, crucial for the platform's functioning. It declares native functions in Java using JNI.
Since it's the most minimal library available, it gives you the most freedom with adjusting the platform to your requirements.
It can be used on Java Virtual Machines (JVM).

This library implements models, exception catching, and the following modules:
- `CryptoApi` - Cryptographic methods used to encrypt/decrypt and sign your data or generate keys to work with Privmx Bridge.
- `Connection` - Methods for managing connection with Privmx Bridge.
- `ThreadApi` - Methods for managing Threads and sending/reading messages.
- `StoreApi` - Methods for managing Stores and sending/reading files.
- `InboxApi` - Methods for managing Inboxes and entries.
