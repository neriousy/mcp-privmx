All the data sent by someone to an Inbox is called an Entry.
In Threads and Stores, a user must be assigned to the container to send data. In Inboxes, however, 
anyone who has Inbox ID can send a reply (assuming they have the Bridge URL and Solution ID).

The sample code on this page is based on the same **[assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**

## Accessing via Public API

Endpoint provides different ways to connect to a Bridge instance.

When using "public" connection you don't have to pass a private key. A random private key will be generated for each connection.
**The public connection provides only the methods related to sending Inbox entries and retrieving public metadata** related to the Inbox.

### Public Connection

To submit data as unregistered user you have to connect using connectPublic(...) and then - prepare and send an Entry.
```ts
const publicConnection = await Endpoint.connectPublic(
    "SOLUTION_ID",
    "BRIDGE_URL"
);
```

You have to pass required Bridge URL and Solution ID. Then use an `inboxApi`.


### Submitting Entries

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Prepare Entry","With meta","With Files"]}>
<Tab>

```ts
const inboxHandle = await inboxApi.prepareEntry(
    "INBOX_ID",
    serializeObject("text to send"),
    [], // no files this time
    undefined  // if logged with private connection, use user private key here.
);

await inboxApi.sendEntry(
    inboxHandle
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
const dataToSend = serializeObject({
        type: 'General inquiry',
        answer: 'Example answer'
    })

const inboxHandle = await inboxApi.prepareEntry(
    "INBOX_ID",
    dataToSend,
    [], // no files this time
    undefined  // if logged with private connection, use user private key here.
);

await inboxApi.sendEntry(inboxHandle);
```
</Tab>

Inboxes allow you to attach files when sending a reply. Each file is automatically streamed during submission.
Similar to Stores, the files can contain private/public metadata.

File info is located inside Entries:
```ts
const dataToSend = serializeObject({
    type: 'General inquiry',
    answer: 'Example answer'
})

const fileHandle = await inboxApi.createFileHandle(
    serializeObject("File publicMeta"),
    serializeObject("File privateMeta"),
    fileSize
);

const inboxHandle = await inboxApi.prepareEntry(
    "INBOX_ID",
    dataToSend,
    [fileHandle], // one file this time
    undefined  // if logged with private connection, use user private key here.
);

await inboxApi.writeToFile(
    inboxHandle,
    fileHandle,
    byteArray
);
// repeat in a loop if needed

await inboxApi.sendEntry(inboxHandle);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Fetching Entries

Fetching entries requires a secure private connection.

<Tabs groupId={'variant'} items={["Fetching entries","Oldest","With Meta"]}>
<Tab>
Fetching the most recent Entries submitted to Inbox:

```js
const defaultListQuery = {skip:0, limit: 100, sortOrder: "desc"};
const entries = await inboxApi.listEntries(
    "INBOX_ID",
    defaultListQuery
);
```

</Tab>
<Tab >
Fetching the oldest Entries (by submission date) in given Inbox:

```js
const defaultListQuery = {skip:0, limit: 100, sortOrder: "asc"};
const entries = await inboxApi.listEntries(
    "INBOX_ID",
    defaultListQuery
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab >
Entries contain list of submitted files.
Each file can contain additional metadata useful for providing info about them, for e.g: file name, size, or author.

```js
const defaultListQuery = {skip:0, limit: 100, sortOrder: "desc"};
const entries = await inboxApi.listEntries(
    "INBOX_ID",
    defaultListQuery
);

const deserializedEntries = entries.readItems.map(entry => {
    return {
        ...entry,
        privateMeta: deserializeObject(entry.privateMeta),
        data: deserializeObject(entry.data),
        files: entry.files.map(file => ({
            ...file,
            privateMeta: deserializeObject(file.privateMeta)
        }))
    };
});
```
</Tab>
