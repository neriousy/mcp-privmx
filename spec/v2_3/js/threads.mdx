Threads are a secure way for assigned members to exchange encrypted messages.

:::info

Before working with Threads, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./introduction). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.
The sample code on this page is based on the same **[assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**

## Working with Threads

When working with Threads, you will use the following:
- `ThreadApi` - provides methods used to manage Threads in given Context

```js
const threadApi  = await Endpoint.createThreadApi(connection);
```
## Creating Threads
<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Basic","With a Name","Public Meta"]}>
<Tab >
Creating a basic, unnamed Thread, which can act as an encrypted data container:

```js
const managers = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

const users = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY},
    {userId: USER2_ID, pubKey: USER2_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

// create a new Thread with access for USER_1 as manager and USER_2 as regular user
const threadId = await threadsApi.createThread(CONTEXT_ID, users, managers,
    serializeObject("some thread's public meta-data"),
    serializeObject("some thread's private meta-data")
);
```
</Tab>
 <Tab >

You can assign any data to private and public meta fields (e.g. the Thread's name), as long as they are serialized to `Uint8Array`.
```js
const privateMeta = {
    name: 'First thread'
};

const managers = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

const users = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY},
    {userId: USER2_ID, pubKey: USER2_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

// create a new Thread with access for user_1 as manager and user_2 as regular user
const threadId = await threadsApi.createThread(CONTEXT_ID, users, managers,
    serializeObject("some thread's public meta-data"),
    serializeObject(privateMeta)
);
```


</Tab>

You can implement a tag system which allows you to create Threads with arbitrary tags.
Putting them inside `publicMeta` gives your own server ability to access it using [PrivMX Bridge API](https://bridge.privmx.dev/).

```js
const privateMeta = {
    name: 'First Thread'
};

const publicMeta = {
    tags: ['TAG1', 'TAG2', 'TAG3']
};

const managers = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

const users = [
    {userId: USER1_ID, pubKey: USER1_PUBLIC_KEY},
    {userId: USER2_ID, pubKey: USER2_PUBLIC_KEY}
];

// create a new Thread with access for USER_1 as manager and USER_2 as regular user
const threadId = await threadsApi.createThread(CONTEXT_ID, users, managers,
    serializeObject(publicMeta),
    serializeObject(privateMeta)
);
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Fetching Threads

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Recent","Sorting","ThreadID","Paging"]}>
<Tab value="recent" label="Most Recent">
Fetching the most recent Threads in given Context:

```js
const defaultListQuery = {skip: 0, limit: 100, sortOrder: "desc"};
const threadList = await threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery);
```
As a result you will receive an object:
```js
// threadList:
{
    readItems: [<threadObject1>, <threadObject2>,..., <threadObjectN>],
    totalAvailable: <number_of_all_threads>
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value={"sorting"} label={"Oldest Threads"}>
Fetching the oldest Threads (by creation date) in given Context:

```js
const defaultListQuery = {skip: 0, limit: 100, sortOrder: "asc"};
const threadList = await threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery);
```
As a result you will receive an object:
```js
// threadList:
{
    readItems: [<threadObject1>, <threadObject2>,..., <threadObjectN>],
    totalAvailable: <number_of_all_threads>
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value={"threadID"} label={"By Thread ID"}>
You can get info about a Thread using its `threadId`:

```js
const thread = await threadApi.getThread(
    threadId    
);

const privateMeta = deserializeObject(thread.privateMeta);
const publicMeta = deserializeObject(thread.publicMeta);
```
As a result you will receive an `Thread` object.
</Tab>

<Tab value={"paging"} label={"Paging"}>
You can change how many items are on a page using `limit` in options object:
```js

const defaultListQuery = {skip: 50, limit: 20, sortOrder: "asc"};
const threadList = await threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery);

```
As a result you will receive an object:
```js
// threadList:
{
    readItems: [THREAD_1,THREAD_2,THREAD_3],
    totalAvailable: NUMBER_OF_THREADS
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

A detailed description of the `Thread` object fields can be found [here](../reference/webendpoint/api-reference/types#thread).

## Modifying Threads


### How Updates Work
To update a Thread you must always provide a full list of parameters.

The `updateThread(...)` method needs all the parameters as in the `createThread(...)` method and a few more. If we want to update
one of the parameters - we provide it in a new modified form. If - on the other hand - we want to leave
the parameter unchanged, we provide it as it was before. All current values ​​of the parameters of a given Thread can be
obtained using `getThread(threadId)`

<Tabs items={["Renaming Thread","Removing User","Deleting Thread"]}>
<Tab>

```js
const thread = await threadApi.getThread(threadId);

const newUsers = thread.users.map(user => ({
    //Your application must provide a way,
    //to get user's public key from their userId.
    userId: user,
    pubKey: 'USER_PUBLIC_KEY'
    })
);

const newManagers = newUsers.filter(user =>
    thread.managers.find(manager => manager == user.userId));

const newPrivateMeta = {
    title: 'New thread name'
};

await threadApi.updateThread(
    threadId
    newUsers,
    newManagers,
    thread.publicMeta,
    serializeObject(newPrivateMeta),
    thread.version,
    false,
    false
);
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
To remove a user from the Thread you must update a list of the users/managers by removing the user you want to get rid of.
All the other values required for update can be taken from the current Thread.

```js
const thread = await threadApi.getThread(threadId);

// Get all users who were in the Thread,
// besides the one you want to remove:
const newUsers = thread.users
  .filter(user => user !== userToRemove)
  .map(user => ({
    // Your application must provide a way,
    // to get user's public key from their userId.
    userId: user,
    pubKey: 'USER_PUBLIC_KEY'
  }));

const newManagers = newUsers.filter(user =>
  thread.managers.find(manager => manager == user.userId)
);

await threadApi.updateThread(
  threadId,
  newUsers,
  newManagers,
  thread.publicMeta,
  thread.privateMeta,
  thread.version,
  false,
  false
);
```

The snippet below deletes Thread and all its data. This action is irreversible.

```js
await threadApi.deleteThread(threadId);
```
