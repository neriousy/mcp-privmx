## Initial Requirements

To start developing end-to-end encrypted applications using PrivMX Web Endpoint you need a **PrivMX Bridge** instance, you can find quick start guide [here](../start/quick-start).

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

When you develop a project using PrivMX, you will most likely use some kind of application server – a server to manage users (and their keys), Contexts, etc. 
It can be new or existing, depending on the specific requirements.

## Using Public and Private Keys
You need a private key to connect the Endpoint to your Bridge. **Private key will never leave the Endpoint**.
- PrivMX Endpoint uses the user's private key to encrypt, decrypt and verify data on the client side only.
- PrivMX Bridge stores only the public part, i.e., the user's public key and user's ID.

## Setting up Web Server to Host JavaScript Assets

To properly integrate PrivMX Web Endpoint library, it's crucial to configure your server. This will ensure the library functions correctly and maintain security. 
You need to set up specific HTTP headers: 
- set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` to `require-corp`;
- set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` to `same-origin`.

These headers are essential to prevent potential cross-origin attacks and to maintain a secure execution environment.

For detailed instructions on how to configure these headers in different environments like Vite, Next.js, Express, and Nginx, 
refer to our [Server Configuration](./application-server) page.

You can also take a look at our [example projects](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-webendpoint/tree/main/examples)
to find server configuration samples.

## Setting up Web Endpoint

:::warning

PrivMX Web Endpoint relies heavily on WebAssembly and browser Web Workers.
Because of that, Web Endpoint is not compatible with the Node.js environments used on the server side and is limited to **browsers only**.
We are actively working on the `@simplito/privmx-endpoint-node` NPM package to support this kind of usage in the future.

:::

PrivMX Web Endpoint is distributed as an NPM package ([@simplito/privmx-webendpoint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@simplito/privmx-webendpoint)) that contains
all the necessary assets and helpers to get started.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download the NPM package for your target project by calling: `npm i @simplito/privmx-webendpoint`.
2. Set up your Web Server to host JavaScript assets properly – [see below](#setting-up-web-server-to-host-javascript-assets).
3. Copy the Endpoint's assets (all .js and .wasm files from `./node_modules/@simplito/privmx-webendpoint/assets`) to your Web Server's public directory.

Finally, to complete the setup process, you have two ways to import the package to your project:

### Importing NPM Package
```ts
import { Endpoint, EventQueue, Types } from "@simplito/privmx-webendpoint";
```

### Using Bundle

First you should copy the `privmx-endpoint-web.js` file (bundle) from the `./node_modules/@simplito/privmx-webendpoint/dist/bundle` directory to your Web Server's public directory.

Next, in your `index.html` add script tag to import the bundle:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="<public_dir>/privmx-endpoint-web.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
You can use it in your app in one of the following methods:

- **From global scope**
    ```js
    // this/window binding
    const Endpoint = PrivmxWebEndpoint.Endpoint;
    // or
    const Endpoint = window.PrivmxWebEndpoint.Endpoint;
    ```
- **CommonJS import**
   ```js
   const Endpoint = require("privmx-webendpoint").Endpoint;
   ```
- **AMD import**
   ```js
   require(['privmx-webendpoint'], function (privmxWebEndpoint) {
   // Do something with the library...
   });
   ```

## Web Endpoint's APIs
You need your Bridge's instance specific data, mentioned [earlier](#initial-requirements), which you should get during the Bridge's setup process.

```js
const  bridgeUrl = "http://localhost:9111";
const  solutionId = "SOLUTION_ID";

const  userPrivKey = "USER_PRIVATE_KEY";
const  userPubKey = "USER_PUBLIC_KEY";
```

First connect to your PrivMX Bridge instance.
Initialize the Endpoint and its WebAssembly dependencies
(provide the Endpoint.setup() function with your Web Server's public directory URL/path
 where the Endpoint assets were copied)
```js
await Endpoint.setup("<public_dir>");
// Create connection to the Bridge Server
const connection = await Endpoint.connect(userPrivKey, solutionId, bridgeUrl);
// Initialize the Threads API
const threadsApi = await Endpoint.createThreadApi(connection);
// call some API methods
const threads = await threadsApi.listThreads(...);
```

## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all the capabilities of Endpoint and Bridge.

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages;
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted files;
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
