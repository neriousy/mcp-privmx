## Initial Requirements

To start developing using PrivMX Endpoint C# you need a [PrivMX Bridge](../start/quick-start) instance.

To connect it to your environment, you need:
  - `Bridge URL` - URL address of the instance of your PrivMX Bridge
  - `Solution ID` - ID of the Solution provided by PrivMX Bridge during its initialization process
  - `User Private Key` - the private key from the user's public-private key pair

You also need to use your own application server to manage users (and their keys) and Contexts.

## Setup a Project

Add a reference to the PrivMX Endpoint package in your existing or a new project. See [Installation](./installation) for available options and detailed steps.

## Initial Assumptions

The initial assumptions for all the code examples below are as follows:

```csharp
const string bridgeUrl = "BRIDGE_URL";
const string solutionId = "SOLUTION_ID";
const string contextId = "CONTEXT_ID";

const string userId = "USER_ID";
const string userPrivKey = "USER_PRIVATE_KEY";
const string userPubKey = "USER_PUBLIC_KEY";
```

All the values above like `BRIDGE_URL`, `SOLUTION_ID`, `CONTEXT_ID`
should be replaced by the ones corresponding to your Bridge Server instance.

The private keys should be kept separately by each user and stored in a safe place,
or generated from a password.
For more information on how to obtain keys, see
[generatePrivateKey()](../reference/privmx-endpoint-csharp/crypto/crypto-api#generateprivatekey)
and
[derivePrivateKey2()](../reference/privmx-endpoint-csharp/crypto/crypto-api#deriveprivatekey2)
methods in the Crypto API.

## Connecting to PrivMX Bridge

To connect to PrivMX, you must provide users's private key, solution ID and bridge URL.
The user's private key do not left out of the library. It is required to using asymetric encryption and singing.

    await ConnectionSession.Create(userPrivKey, userPubKey, solutionId, bridgeUrl);

```csharp
connection.Disconnect();
```

<Tab>
```csharp
await session.DisposeAsync();

## Next Steps

With everything ready to go, now it's time to start using all of the platform's capabilities.

Learn how to use:

-   [**Threads**](../start/threads/overview) - for exchanging encrypted messages;
-   [**Stores**](../start/stores/overview) - for saving and sharing encrypted files;
-   [**Inboxes**](../start/inboxes/overview) - for one way communication with external users.
