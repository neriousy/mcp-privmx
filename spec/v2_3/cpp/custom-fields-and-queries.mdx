description: Using custom fields and querying them in Thread and Store containers.  
---

Custom fields and querying them is a functionality that works with Threads and Stores containers.

It allows you to define new fields by placing them in the `publicMeta` of a container or an object within a given container, 
and then querying the PrivMX Endpoint Client (using existing listing methods) for elements containing these previously defined fields.

Sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**.

## Working with Custom Fields and Queries

Below there is a simple code example of how to add a **custom field** to a batch of Threads, and then search for them using **custom query**.


### Initial Setup

Let's add some required includes and initialize the PrivMX Endpoint Client with the Thread API:
```cpp
// ...

#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Connection.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/thread/ThreadApi.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Buffer.hpp>

// ...

// initialize Endpoint connection and Threads API
auto connection {core::Connection::connect(USER1_PRIVATE_KEY, SOLUTION_ID, BRIDGE_URL)};
auto threadApi {thread::ThreadApi::create(connection)};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> threadUsers {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};
```

### Defining a Sample Custom Field
```cpp
// ...

std::string threadCustomField = R"(
    {
        "threadType": "special"
    }
)";

// ...
```

### Creating Threads

The following code will create a total of 6 new Threads. 3 of them will contain a Custom Field.

```cpp
// ...

// Creating some ordinary Threads
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    threadApi.createThread(
        CONTEXT_ID, 
        threadUsers, threadUsers, 
        core::Buffer::from(""),
        core::Buffer::from("Ordinary thread")
    );
}

// Creating some Threads with the custom field
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    threadApi.createThread(
        CONTEXT_ID, 
        threadUsers, threadUsers, 
        core::Buffer::from(threadCustomField),
        core::Buffer::from("Thread with the custom field")
    );
}

// ...
```

### Listing Threads
The next piece of code will demonstrate how you can filter the results of the `listThreads(...)` method using built-in it Custom Queries functionality
to get the Threads containing the previously defined Custom Field.

```cpp
// ...

// Quering over Threads
core::PagingQuery defaultListQuery = {.skip = 0, .limit = 10, .sortOrder = "desc"};
auto threadsList1 {threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery)};

core::PagingQuery customQuery = {.skip = 0, .limit = 10, .sortOrder = "desc", .queryAsJson = threadCustomField};
auto threadsList2 {threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, customQuery)};

std::cout << "The list of all Threads:" << std::endl;
for (auto t: threadsList1.readItems) {
    std::cout << "ThreadId: " << t.threadId << " / privateMeta: " << t.privateMeta.stdString() << std::endl;
}

std::cout << "The list of Threads with the custom field:" << std::endl;
for (auto t: threadsList2.readItems) {
    std::cout << "ThreadId: " << t.threadId << " / privateMeta: " << t.privateMeta.stdString() << std::endl;
}

// ...
```

The results of the example above will look similar to those below:

```
The list of all Threads:
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10ec / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10eb / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10ea / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10e9 / privateMeta: Ordinary thread
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10e8 / privateMeta: Ordinary thread
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10e7 / privateMeta: Ordinary thread

The list of Threads with the custom field:
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10ec / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10eb / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
ThreadId: 6809fb0b57a381d1a23f10ea / privateMeta: Thread with the custom field
```
