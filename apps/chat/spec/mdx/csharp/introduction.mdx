This part of the documentation describes our solutions to simplify working with PrivMX Endpoint library on the .NET platform.

## Requirements

PrivMX Endpoint for C# are .NET Standard 2.1 libraries, which can be running using .NET Runtime, Mono or Unity.

Supported runtimes are:
    - Windows: `win-x64`
    - Linux: `linux-x64`
    - macOS: `osx-arm64`

Additionally, in progress and available soon:
    - iOS: `ios-arm64`
    - Android: `android-arm64`, `android-arm`

## Libraries

### PrivMX Endpoint C#

PrivMX Endpoint C# is the minimal native library wrapper. It declares import functions using Platform Invoke
(P/Invoke) and maps data between native objects and C# objects.

For detailed descriptions of each class, see [API Reference](../reference/privmx-endpoint-csharp/core/backend-requester)
or the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-csharp).

### PrivMX Endpoint C# Extra

PrivMX Endpoint C# Extra provides additional functionality for PrivMX Endpoint C#.
It adds asynchronous methods, additional abstraction of event dispatching, reading and writing files.
This package is the recommended for using PrivMX in most cases.

For detailed descriptions of each class, see [API Reference](../reference/privmx-endpoint-csharp-extra/core/async-connection)
or the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-csharp-extra).
