title: Metrics

PrivMX Bridge provides a `/metrics` endpoint that returns various metrics in a format compatible with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). The endpoint is protected by HTTP Basic Authorization for security.

## Metrics Endpoint

- **Endpoint**: `/metrics`
- **Access Control**: Requires HTTP Basic Authorization
- **Scrape Interval**: 1 minute (data older than 1 minute is discarded)
- **Bucket Clearing**: After each metric collection via the `/metrics` endpoint, the internal metrics bucket is cleared. This enables the endpoint to support scrape intervals shorter than 1 minute, if desired.

## Metrics Collected
The following metrics are available from the `/metrics` endpoint:

1. `privmx_bridge_error_gauge`
 - Type: Gauge
 - Description: Tracks the number of errors.
2. `privmx_bridge_cpu_execution_time_gauge`
 - Type: Gauge
 - Description: Measures the CPU time taken for executions.
3. `privmx_bridge_in_traffic_gauge`
 - Type: Gauge
 - Description: Records incoming traffic volume in bytes.
4. `privmx_bridge_out_traffic_gauge`
 - Type: Gauge
 - Description: Records outgoing traffic volume in bytes.
5. `privmx_bridge_request_gauge`
 - Type: Gauge
 - Description: Counts the number of requests.

Each of these metrics is exposed with the `# TYPE <metric_name>` gauge format.
