title: Certificates
---

Each wrapper uses SSL connection for all the communication between PrivMX Endpoint and PrivMX Bridge.
Since Bridge is locally installed by the developer, it's necessary to provide certificates for this connection.

You can use proper function in each language for setting the certificates:

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Swift","Kotlin"]}>
<Tab >
```swift
var endpointContainer: PrivMXEndpointContainer = PrivMXEndpointContainer()
		
guard let pathToCerts = FileManager.default
    .urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    .first?.appendingPathComponent("cert.pem").path()
else {return}

try? endpointContainer.setCertsPath(to: pathToCerts)

```
</Tab>
<Tab >
```kotlin
val endpointContainer = PrivmxEndpointContainer()
endpointContainer.setCertsPath("YOUR-PATH-TO-CERTS-FILE.pem")
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Source of Certificates

If you use properly signed certificates issued by a trusted CA, you can provide them for the Endpoint. For example CA Certificates from Mozilla:

- [Mozilla's Included Certificates](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates)
- [CURL - CA certificates extracted from Mozilla](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html)

## Custom Certificates

If your Bridge has custom signed certificates, provide them accordingly.


<Callout type={"info"} title={"On the Web"}>
    If you use PrivMX Endpoint in web environment with custom certificates, you should add them as trusted to your system.
</Callout>

## Using PrivMX Endpoint with a Non-Secure Bridge Installation

For development purposes, the Bridge can be installed locally and accessed by a non-secure HTTP connection.
In such a case, you can omit adding certificates to PrivMX Endpoint and configure your app properly by editing the `Info.plist` file:

```
App Transport Security Settings > Allow Arbitrary Loads > YES
```
