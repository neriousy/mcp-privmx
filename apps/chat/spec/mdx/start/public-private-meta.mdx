title: Public/Private Meta
---

In PrivMX, you create apps using Containers. Containers are a collection of versatile building blocks that can be used to implement
anything from a basic chat to an encrypted file storage.
Containers can contain items; for instance, in the Threads Container, these items are messages.
Both Containers and items have two common fields `publicMeta` and `privateMeta`:

| **Field**    | **Encrypted** | **Format**   | **Description**                                         |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Private Meta | Yes           | Binary Array | Can be read only by Container members.                     |
| Public Meta  | No            | Binary Array | Can be fetched using PrivMX Bridge API and all members. |


## Defining Structure
Both private and public meta is sent as a binary array.
This makes the fields very versatile, both in terms of the format they use and the structure they contain.

Container's architecture does not require you to use a specific data structure inside the public and private meta.
So before working with a Container, define what kind of info you will need in your application.

Let's say you want to assign name to your Container.
You may decide to put the name in `publicMeta` if it doesn't contain sensitive data,
or you will need to download it on the server.
In case the name contains sensitive user data, a better choice is to place it in `privateMeta`,
so that it will be encrypted before sending.

This will greatly increase the security of your application at the cost
of your application server not having access to this data.

## Serializing Data
The easiest and most common format for serialization is JSON.
All modern languages have a way to serialize key-value data structures to a JSON string and from string to a binary array.

Following the previous example we can define simple structure with `name` property.

<Tabs items={["JavaScript"]}>
<Tab>

```ts
const privateMeta = {
   name: NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTAINER
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Serialize it to binary array:

<Tabs items={["JavaScript"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```ts
        const privateMeta = {
            name: NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTAINER
        }
        const encoder = new TextEncoder()
        const serialized = encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(privateMeta))
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can now pass it while creating your Container, e.g., Thread:
<Tabs items={["JavaScript"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```ts
        const privateMeta = {
            name: NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTAINER
        }
        const encoder = new TextEncoder()
        const serialized = encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(privateMeta))

        await threadApi.createThread(
            CONTEXT_ID,
            [THREAD_MEMBERS],
            [THREAD_MANAGERS],
            new Uint8Array() // this thread doesn't have publicMeta so we pass empty Uint8Array
            serialized,
        )
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


Remember that it is only an example and you should always consider your app's requirements and limitations.

## Good Practices

We recommend future-proofing your meta right from the start.

### Using Easily Modifiable Format
While it's possible to pass plain text or a number (encoded to a binary array), it's advised to use
something like JSON or other key-value format.
In case of changes in app requirements, it is easier to add or remove a field than change an entire type
of field.

```json title="Bad practice"
//rest of container fields
publicMeta:"published"
```

```json title="Good practice"
//rest of container fields
publicMeta:{
  status:"published"
}
```

### Adding Schema Version
This simplifies adding support for backwards compatibility. Versions can have different fields or may introduce
changes in field types.

```json title="Good practice"
//rest of container fields
publicMeta:{
  _ver: 2 // [!code highlight]
  status:"published"
}
```
