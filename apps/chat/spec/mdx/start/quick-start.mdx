title: Quick Start
---
PrivMX is a **Zero-Knowledge software** – it has no possibility of reading (decrypting) data it transmits and stores.

**User’s registration in PrivMX Bridge Contexts requires providing only user’s public key and any textual userId assigned by the application.**
As a result, PrivMX communication channels can be easily used in existing applications, with no necessary changes to the authorization system currently in use.
## Installation
:::tip

Before you start, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
You might also want to use PrivMX Bridge in non dockerized version, which requires more configuration and is recommended for advanced users. In that case, please refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-bridge)

:::

To install Bridge on your machine you can use our CLI.

1. Clone Bridge CLI
     ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/simplito/privmx-bridge-docker
    ```
2. Run setup script
    ```shell
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    This will fetch the necessary Docker images, create Access Keys and your first Context. After a successful setup, CLI
    will
    display all the API keys necessary for connection. <br/>

### Registering first users (optionally)

You can create first two users using provided CLI. This can come handy if you want to just test PrivMX in  one of our example projects.

1. Generate keys
    In your terminal, generate private-public key pair for your user. The keys must be in WIF format
    To learn more about private and public keys, browse our [dedicated section](../start/generating-keys)
    ```shell
    ./genKeyPair.sh
   ```
2. Register user

    With the keys ready, register `userId` - public key pair in your Context. Don't forget to replace placeholder values
    with the ones created earlier:
    ```shell
    ./cli.sh context/addUserToContext '{"contextId": "CONTEXT_ID", "userId":"USER_ID", "userPubKey":"USER_PUBLIC_KEY" }'
    ```
