## Introduction

PrivMX does not provide a user management service. However, each application user has to be granted access to specific resources within the Platform.

For user management, you must provide your own **application server** that can perform the following tasks:

- Registering new user ID - public key pairs in [Context](/docs/start/features#context) (e.g., during a sign-up process).
- Storing information about user profiles.
- Providing a set of users with whom the user can establish communication (e.g., creating new Thread).

When a user's key pair is generated (which should happen on the userâ€™s device, not the server), **only the public key** needs to be sent to the **application server**.
The server can then assign the user to the desired Context.

This process ensures secure key management while allowing the application to control user access.

### Requirements

To enable communication between the application server and PrivMX, the server needs to use an **API Key**.

Each generated API key consists of an `API_KEY_ID` and a **secret** `API_KEY_SECRET`. Both need to be stored in environment variables.
API key also has an associated access control list, which defines the PrivMX functions it can execute.

If you are using [PrivMX Bridge Docker](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-bridge-docker),
your first API Key will be provided after the initial PrivMX Bridge setup.

### Public Key Registration

For authorization requests to PrivMX Bridge, use your API Key to request an Access Token.
Access Tokens have a TTL but can be refreshed using refresh tokens.
Here is an example in Node.js:



  ```ts title="TypeScript"
async function getAccessToken() {
  const requestBody = {
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    id: 128,
    method: "manager/auth",
    params: {
      scope: ["solution:*", "context"],
      grantType: "api_key_credentials",
      apiKeyId: API_KEY_ID,
      apiKeySecret: API_KEY_SECRET,
    },
  };

  const tokenRequest = await fetch(BRIDGE_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
  });

  const response = await tokenRequest.json();

  if (tokenRequest.status === 200) {
    return response.result.accessToken;
  } else if ("error" in response) {
    throw new Error(`Unable to get access token`);
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Unknown error`);
  }
}
```

The Access Token can be used to authorize your request by placing it in the Authorization header.
To add a public key to a Context use [`context/addUserToContext`](https://bridge.privmx.dev/#context-addusertocontext) Rpc method.



  ```ts title="TypeScript"
export async function addUserToContext(userId: string, pubKey: string) {
  //using function from earlier
  const accessToken = await getAccessToken();

  const response = await fetch(YOUR_BRIDGE_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
      id: 128,
      method: "context/addUserToContext",
      params: {
        contextId: CONTEXT_ID,
        userId: USER_ID_ASSOCIATED_WITH_PUBLIC_KEY,
        userPubKey: PUBLIC_KEY,
      },
    }),
    headers: {
      "Content-type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });
}
```

Your user can now connect to your PrivMX Bridge providing a matching private key to PrivMX Endpoint in your
client app.
For guidance on how to do this in your app's stack, refer to our language-specific documentation:
