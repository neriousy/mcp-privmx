## A.B.C-rcX versioning

Each version of the project is marked with semantic numbering. Here are the detailed rules:

### New features

Changes in `A` and `B` numbers introduce new features:

• `A` (major): changes in the event of major updates or the introduction of incompatible features.

• `B` (minor): changes in the event of minor updates, which are **in most cases** compatible with previous versions.

### Consistency of numbering

The main library and all the wrappers use the same `A` and `B` versioning.

### Updates within the version:

• `C` changes consist of fixes and updates that do not introduce new features – they are only bug and optimization fixes.

• `C` does not have to be synchronized between the library and the wrappers.

### Release Candidate (rc)

The `X` in `A.B.C-rcX` stands for the consecutive release candidates for given version.

### Before official release

• Before making a final release decision in the team, all the components (the library and the wrappers) are released as `A.B.C-rcX`.

• At the `rc` stage, changes connected to the new API are possible and they change the `X`.

### Finalizing a version

When the main library and the wrappers reach full compatibility in a given version, a stable version of A.B.C is published, with all the components synchronized.

### Minor changes (B)

• Adding small features or items to replace older functionality bumps up the `B` number.

• Replaced and changed functions will be marked as deprecated, but still work until a version with a bumped up `A` number is released.

• However, we do not exclude the **possibility that compatibility will be broken** at this stage. We will inform about it in release-notes.

### Major changes (A)

Introducing major changes or features, requires the `A` number increase.
