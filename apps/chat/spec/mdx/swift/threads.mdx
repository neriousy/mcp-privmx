Threads are a secure way for assigned members to exchange encrypted messages.

:::info

Before working with Threads, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.\
\
The sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./getting-started#initial-assumptions)**.\
\
All policies in the following examples can be build with [Policy Builders](./policy-builders), according to [Policies overview](../start/concepts/policies).

## Working with Threads

To access Threads methods, get the field [`threadApi`](../../reference/privmx-endpoint-swift/threads/thread-api/) from the active `endpointSession`. Session should be initialized with `[.thread]` and passed to `PrivmxEndpoint`.

```swift
endpointSession?.threadApi? // instance of ThreadApi
```

## Creating Threads

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Basic","With a Name","With publicMeta"]}>
<Tab>
Creating a basic, unnamed Thread, which can act as an encrypted data container.
```swift
let users = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
let managers = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
let publicMeta = Data()
let privateMeta = Data()

_ = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.createThread(
    in: contextId,
    for: users,
    managedBy: managers,
    withPublicMeta: publicMeta,
    withPrivateMeta: privateMeta,
    withPolicies: nil
    )
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
You can assign any data to private and public meta fields (e.g. the Thread's name), as long as they are serialized to byte array.
```swift
let users = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
let managers = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
guard let publicMeta = "Title".data(using: .utf8) else {return}
let privateMeta = Data()

_ = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.createThread(
    in: contextId,
    for: users,
    managedBy: managers,
    withPublicMeta: publicMeta,
    withPrivateMeta: privateMeta,
    withPolicies: nil)
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
You can implement a tag system which allows you to create Threads with arbitrary tags. Putting them inside `publicMeta` gives your own server the ability to access it using [PrivMX Bridge API](https://bridge.privmx.dev/).

Define Thread public meta structure:
```swift
struct ThreadPublicMeta: Codable{
    let tags: [String]
}

        
let users = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
let managers = [privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey]() //should be prepared by developer
let threadPublicMeta = ThreadPublicMeta(tags: ["TAG1","TAG2","TAG3"])
guard let privateMeta = "Title".data(using: .utf8) else {return}
guard let publicMeta = try? JSONEncoder().encode(threadPublicMeta) else {return}

_ = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.createThread(
    in: contextId,
    for: users,
    managedBy: managers,
    withPublicMeta: publicMeta,
    withPrivateMeta: privateMeta,
    withPolicies: nil)
```

## Getting Threads


<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Most Recent","Oldest","By `threadId`"]}>
<Tab>
Fetching the most recent Threads in given Context:
```swift
var startIndex:Int64 = 0
var pageSize:Int64 = 100

guard let pagingList = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?
.listThreads(
    from:contextId,
    basedOn: .init(skip: startIndex, limit: pageSize, sortOrder: .desc)) else {return}

let threads = pagingList.readItems.map { $0 }
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
Fetching the oldest Threads (by creation date) in given Context:
```swift
var startIndex:Int64 = 0
var pageSize:Int64 = 100
        
guard let pagingList = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?
.listThreads(
    from:contextId,
    basedOn: .init(skip: startIndex, limit: pageSize, sortOrder: .asc)) else {return}

let threads =
pagingList.readItems.map { $0 }
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
You can get info about a Thread using its `threadId`:
```swift
var threadID = "THREAD_ID"

guard let thread = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?
    .getThread(threadID) else {return}

```

## Managing Threads

<Tabs groupId="variant" items={["Renaming Thread","Removing User","Deleting Thread"]}>
<Tab>
To update a Thread you must always provide its current version, as well as:
- list of users
- list of managers
- new private and public meta (even if it didn't change)
- Thread's current version
- `true` if update action should be forced

```swift
struct ThreadPublicMeta:Codable{
    let tags: [String]
}
var threadID = "THREAD_ID"

        
let threadPublicMeta = ThreadPublicMeta(tags: ["TAG1","TAG2","TAG3"])
guard let publicMeta = try? JSONEncoder().encode(threadPublicMeta) else {return}
guard let thread = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?
    .getThread(threadID) else {return}

//users list to be extracted from thread
let users = thread.users.map{
    //Your application must provide a way,
    //to get user's public key from their userId.
    privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey(userId: $0, pubKey: "PUB")
}
//managers list to be extracted from thread
let managers = thread.managers.map{
    //Your application must provide a way,
    //to get user's public key from their userId.
    privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey(userId: $0, pubKey: "PUB")
}

guard let newPrivateMeta = "New thread name".data(using: .utf8) else {return}

_ = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.updateThread(
    threadID,
    atVersion: thread.version,
    replacingUsers: users,
    replacingManagers: managers,
    replacingPublicMeta: thread.publicMeta.getData() ?? Data(),
    replacingPrivateMeta: newPrivateMeta,
    force:false,
    forceGenerateNewKey: false,
    replacingPolicies: nil)

```
</Tab>

<Tab>
To remove a user from a Thread you must provide:
- list of all the users, without the user you want to remove
- list of managers
- new private and public meta (even if it didn't change)
- Thread's current version
- `true` if update action should be forced

```swift
struct ThreadPublicMeta:Codable{
    let tags: [String]
}
var threadID = "THREAD_ID"
        
let threadPublicMeta = ThreadPublicMeta(tags: ["TAG1","TAG2","TAG3"])
guard let publicMeta = try? JSONEncoder().encode(threadPublicMeta) else {return}
guard let thread = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?
    .getThread(threadID) else {return}

//users list to be extracted from thread
let users = thread.users.filter{
    $0 != "username-to-remove"
}.map{
    //Your application must provide a way,
    //to get user's public key from their userId.
    privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey(userId: $0, pubKey: "PUB")
}
//managers list to be extracted from thread
let managers = thread.managers.map{
    //Your application must provide a way,
    //to get user's public key from their userId.
    privmx.endpoint.core.UserWithPubKey(userId: $0, pubKey: "PUB")
}

guard let newPrivateMeta = "New thread name".data(using: .utf8) else {return}

_ = try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.updateThread(
    threadID,
    atVersion: thread.version,
    replacingUsers: users,
    replacingManagers: managers,
    replacingPublicMeta: thread.publicMeta.getData() ?? Data(),
    replacingPrivateMeta: newPrivateMeta,
    force:false,
    forceGenerateNewKey: false,
    replacingPolicies: nil)

The snippet below deletes Thread and all its data. This action is irreversible.
```swift
var threadID = "THREAD_ID"
try? endpointSession?.threadApi?.deleteThread(threadID)
