## Libraries

### PrivMX Endpoint Kotlin Extra

PrivMX Endpoint Kotlin Extra is the fundamental **recommended library** for using the platform
in the majority of cases. It encompasses all the essential logic that simplifies and secures the
usage of our libraries.

This library implements:

- Enums and static fields to reduce errors while using the methods.
- [`PrivmxEndpoint`](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/com.simplito.kotlin.privmx_endpoint_extra.lib/-privmx-endpoint/index.html) for managing connection and registering callbacks on any events.
- [`PrivmxEndpointContainer`](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/com.simplito.kotlin.privmx_endpoint_extra.lib/-privmx-endpoint-container/index.html) for managing global session with implemented event loop.
- Classes to simplify reading and writing to files using byte arrays, InputStream/OutputStream or Source/Sink (kotlinx.io), depending on the platform and use case.

[Go to Reference](/reference/kotlin/privmx-endpoint-extra/index.html) for a detailed description of each class
or see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-kotlin/tree/main/privmx-endpoint-extra).

### PrivMX Endpoint Kotlin

PrivMX Endpoint Kotlin is the minimal wrapper library, essential for the platformâ€™s operational
functionality. It declares native functions in Kotlin using JNI. As the most minimalist library
available, it provides the highest degree of flexibility in customizing the platform to meet your
specific requirements.

This library implements models, exception catching, and the following modules:
- `CryptoApi` - Cryptographic methods used to encrypt/decrypt and sign your data or generate keys to work with PrivMX Bridge.
- `Connection` - Methods for managing connection with PrivMX Bridge.
- `ThreadApi` - Methods for managing Threads and sending/reading messages.
- `StoreApi` - Methods for managing Stores and sending/reading files.
- `InboxApi` - Methods for managing Inboxes and entries.
