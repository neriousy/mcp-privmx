## Messages Inside Threads

Messages inside Threads are sent in binary format. Before sending a message, you need to decide on the message format.

For more information about the Threads architecture and best practices for sending messages, visit the
[Threads Documentation](../start/threads/overview).

## Sending Messages

Sending a simple message to the given Thread:

```cpp
// ...

// send messages to the Thread represented by its threadId
threadApi.sendMessage(
    threadId, 
    core::Buffer::from("some public meta-data"), 
    core::Buffer::from("some private meta-data"), 
    core::Buffer::from("serialized message data")
);

// ...
```

## Get the Thread's Messages

To get a list of messages inside a Thread, use `getMessages` method. Because data inside messages is in `core::Buffer`
you have to deserialize it to human-readable string.
**PrivMX Endpoint library takes care of encrypting your data before sending it to PrivMX Bridge.**

Reading the messages of the Thread (limited to the 100 newest entries as described by the `defaultListQuery` object):

```cpp
// ...

auto messages = threadApi.listMessages(threadId, defaultListQuery);
for (auto msg: messages.readItems) {
    std::cout << "message: " << msg.data.stdString()
        << " / public meta: " << msg.publicMeta.stdString() 
        << " / private meta: " << msg.privateMeta.stdString() 
        << std::endl;
}

// ...
```
