:::info

Before working with Threads, follow our [Getting Started Guide](./introduction). It will show you how to set up your project to work with PrivMX Bridge.
Sample code on this page is based on the **[initial assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**.

## Working with Threads

When working with Threads, you will use the following:
- `ThreadApi` - provides methods used to manage Threads in given Context


Let's modify the program from the [First App](./first-app) chapter to connect to the Bridge server, create a Thread, and send the first message in it.

**`CMakeLists.txt`**
```cmake
...
target_link_libraries(test_program PUBLIC 
		privmxendpoint::privmxendpointcore
        privmxendpoint::privmxendpointthread
		privmxendpoint::crypto
)
```

**`main.cpp`**

```cpp
// setup some defaults
core::PagingQuery defaultListQuery = {.skip = 0, .limit = 100, .sortOrder = "desc"};

// initialize Endpoint connection and Threads API
auto connection {core::Connection::connect(USER1_PRIVATE_KEY, SOLUTION_ID, BRIDGE_URL)};
auto threadApi {thread::ThreadApi::create(connection)};

// ...
```
## Creating Threads
Creating a basic, unnamed Thread, which can act as an encrypted data container:

```cpp
// ...

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> managers {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> users {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY},
    {.userId = USER2_ID, .pubKey = USER2_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

// create a new Thread with access for USER_1 as manager and USER_2 as regular user
auto threadId {threadApi.createThread(
    CONTEXT_ID, 
    users, managers, 
    core::Buffer::from("some thread's public meta-data"), 
    core::Buffer::from("some thread's private meta-data")
)};

// ...
```
Hint: You can assign any data to private and public meta fields (e.g. the Thread's name), as long as it is serialized and can be given as the `core::Buffer`.

## Fetching Threads

Getting a list of Threads available for the user in the given Context:

```cpp
// ...

auto threadsList = threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery);

// ...
```

As a result you will receive an object:
```cpp
// threadsList:
{
    readItems: [<threadObject1>, <threadObject2>,..., <threadObjectN>],
    totalAvailable: <number_of_all_threads>
}
```

Getting a single Thread:

```cpp
// ...

auto thread = threadApi.getThread(threadId, defaultListQuery);

// ...
```
A detailed description of the `Thread` object fields can be found in [API Reference](../reference/endpoint/thread/types#thread).

## Modifying Threads


### How Updates Work
To update a Thread you must always provide a full list of parameters.

The `updateThread(...)` method needs all the parameters as in the `createThread(...)` method and a few more. If you want to update
one of the parameters – provide it in a new modified form. If, on the other hand, you want to leave
the parameter unchanged – provide it as it was before.

```cpp
// ...
auto currentThread {threadApi.getThread(threadId, defaultListQuery)};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> managers {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

std::vector<core::UserWithPubKey> users {
    {.userId = USER1_ID, .pubKey = USER1_PUBLIC_KEY}
};

// update a new Thread with access for USER_1 as the only user.
auto threadId {threadApi.updateThread(
    threadId, 
    users, managers, 
    currentThread.publicMeta, 
    currentThread.privateMeta,
    currentThread.version, // <- pass the version of the Thread you will perform the update on
    false, // <- force update (without checking version)
    false // <- force to regenerate a key for the Thread
)};

// ...
```
