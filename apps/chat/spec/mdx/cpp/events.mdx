description: Events allow your application to respond to changes in user context instantly. These events are automatically captured when relevant changes occur. You can subscribe to them by registering event listeners.

## The EventQueue And Handling Events

:::info

Sample code on this page is based on the same **[initial assumptions](./first-app#initial-assumptions)**.

:::
### Key Considerations

Please note the following:

- Events will only trigger for active connections.
- Events are not captured unless explicitly listened for.
- A single instance of the `eventQueue` is shared across all connections.


### Handling The Incoming Event
Below there is simple code example of how to handle an event coming after new message has been sent to the Thread.


```cpp
// ...

#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Connection.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/thread/ThreadApi.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/core/Buffer.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/core/EventQueue.hpp>
#include <privmx/endpoint/thread/Events.hpp>

// ...
core::EventQueue eventQueue {core::EventQueue::getInstance()};

// Start the EventQueue reading loop
std::thread t([&](){
    while(true) {
        core::EventHolder event = eventQueue.waitEvent();
        if (thread::Events::isThreadNewMessageEvent(event)) {
            auto msgEvent = thread::Events::extractThreadNewMessageEvent(event);
            auto message = msgEvent.data;
            std::cout << "Message: " << message.data.stdString() << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Author: " << message.info.author << std::endl;
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(5));
    }
});

// ...

// initialize the connection to the Bridge and the Threads API
auto connection {core::Connection::connect(USER1_PRIVATE_KEY, SOLUTION_ID, BRIDGE_URL)};
auto threadApi {thread::ThreadApi::create(connection)};
core::PagingQuery defaultListQuery = {.skip = 0, .limit = 100, .sortOrder = "desc"};

// Get a Thread to work with
auto currentThread {threadApi.listThreads(CONTEXT_ID, defaultListQuery).readItems[0]};

// Subscribe for the Thread's events
threadApi.subscribeForMessageEvents(currentThread.threadId);

// Send a sample message
threadApi.sendMessage(currentThread.threadId, core::Buffer::from(""), core::Buffer::from(""), core::Buffer::from("some message"));

t.join();
```
As soon as the new message arrives to the Thread - the `ThreadNewMessageEvent` will be emitted and handled by the `EventQueue`.
